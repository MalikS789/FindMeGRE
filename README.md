An Android application created for my final year project that attempts to use fingerprint-based localization to find a person’s room location using only the detected WiFi access points and their signal strengths. The algorithms used from the attempt are Error Controlled Localization (modified), Nearest Neighbour, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network.

Date of creation: 03/03/2019
Lbraries used: LibSVM and Neuroph.
